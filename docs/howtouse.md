# About `nasm-to-wasm` 

Not all the commands in Netwide Assembler programming language is supported by me, but you can use some basic ones like `mov`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div` and `idiv`.  

Example Netwide Assembler script: `main.nasm` - Compute the sum of 2 integers
```
section .text 
  global sum

sum:
  mov rax, rdi
  add rax, rsi
  ret
```
Here are the instructions to use `./nasm-to-wasm`  

__Note__: This depends on `wabt`, so you need to install it first by using `sudo apt install wabt --yes`.  

***NASM --> WAT --> WASM***  

From that way to compile, I do not think it is a great idea to read these instructions.

## Compile into WebAssembly Text (WAT):
```
./nasm-to-wasm -i inputfile.nasm -o outputfile.wat
```
- `-i`, `--input`: Specify a `.nasm` or `.asm` file to compile (recommend: `.nasm`);
- `-o`, `--output`: Take down the name of the file you want to receive after compiling. If not specified, the default is `inputfile.wasm`.

## Compile into WebAssembly binary (WASM):
```
./nasm-to-wasm -i inputfile.nasm -o outputfile.wasm
```
Even you choose the option to compile into WebAssembly Text or WebAssembly binary, you still have an extra JavaScript file in order to push it into website, like this (`main.js`):
```
export async function loadWasm() {
    // Load WebAssembly normal functions:
    const response = await fetch("{outputfile}");
    const bytes = await response.arrayBuffer();
    const result = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes);
    return result.instance;
}

```
## Establish a website to test

To make sure it works on your website, please test like this:  
- You need to make some directories.
- Imagine the output JavaScript file is `main.js`

__index.html:__
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>WASM TEST</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="demo"></h1>
    <script type="module" src="frontend.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
__frontend.js:__
```
import { loadWasm } from './main.js'

loadWasm().then(instance => {
    const add = instance.exports.add;
    const result = add(15, 60);
    document.getElementById("demo").textContent = result;
});
```

## Run the test website

*Visual Studio Code is recommended to run this web with Live Server extension*

Open your website using Live Server to check the result.

## Note:
- Make sure that `index.html`, `frontend.js`, `main.js` and `main.wasm` are in the same directory in order to work.
